### PWAC battle stories

Mar 2023  

Nineteen months ago Singapore Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng called to ask me to serve on the Advisory Committee for Platform Workers.  That work threw me into over a year and a half of engagement alongside the rest of the Committee and an awesome collection of dedicated public servants at the Ministry. We held what seemed like weekly meetings at Ministry. We put together over a dozen engagements and got in front of townhalls of hundreds of ordinary people and platform workers, and dozens of platform companies. We submitted a set of recommendations to the Government.  

This evening we got together and shared battle stories.  Good times.
