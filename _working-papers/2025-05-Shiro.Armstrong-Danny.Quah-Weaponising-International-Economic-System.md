excerpt: 'Economic exchange between countries has always involved commercial, political, and security risks. Those risks have been managed under the US-led rules-based multilateral order for those countries that signed up to the system. That system was forged in the dying stages of World War II in Bretton Woods and no country benefited from the resulting economic order more than the United States. Now the United States is the system’s biggest disrupter. China’s rise as an economic power and competitor to the United States and the US response has led to fragmentation of the current economic order. As a result, the globalisation that flourished as a result brought prosperity and peace is now under threat. '
