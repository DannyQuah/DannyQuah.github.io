excerpt: "This paper analyzes potential population responses to changing patterns of trade and technology. The mechanism studied is in wage-price dynamics, and is novel in its drawing on assumptions surrounding the cheapness of poor nations, on the one hand, and the Washington Consensus, on the other.  By re-interpreting a line of reasoning due to Ricardo Hausmann, the paper shows empirically  that small nations are economically surprisingly successful.  This finding contradicts the implications of theoretical models of national economies where aggregate economic performance draws on diversity, complexity, or increasing returns to scale.  For small states to succeed relative to those economies that are larger but otherwise comparable, trade matters importantly. The effects of technological improvement are not monotone, but vary with the wage-price characteristics of those sectors where technology pulls ahead. That advanced technology correlates with complexity is important on average, but less so among the most extreme of national economic successes."
