excerpt: "What is a platform company and how are platform workers different from ordinary employees? This paper provides definitions to make explicit the legislative and regulatory contexts for platform worker social protection. But if such protection results in higher costs for companies engaging platform workers, how will that impact consumer prices and platform workers? This paper analyzes price pass-through under a range of assumptions. It concludes that in typical circumstances predicted price responses will be relatively minor. If, however, price responses turn out to be large, that also reveals the extent to which platform companies are exercising market power, failing to innovate, and, by implication, marking up prices unnecessarily."
