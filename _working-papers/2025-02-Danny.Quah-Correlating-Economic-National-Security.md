excerpt: "Its proponents argue that geopolitics should take priority over economics uncompromisingly, since national security and free markets point in opposite directions.  But a world that conducts industrial policy already takes as given that free markets don't guarantee optimal outcomes.  In such a world, geopolitical concerns only add one more dimension to already-extant tradeoffs surrounding industrial policy.  How should national security compare with other drivers of industrial policy?  What evidence might help diagnose whether national security helps guide good economic policy or provides cover for unsound practice?  This paper provides a simple analytical model to address these questions. The model shows how as national security concerns vary there is a tipping point below which their effects are quiescent, but above which such concerns have ever greater impact. In the model, a Prisoners Dilemma situation between nations emerges but other nations can help reduce the otherwise-resulting (``epic fail'') gridlock and inefficiency. Near the tipping point, minimal efforts have higher than proportional impact, so that nudges, even by small states, can have significant effects on world order. Applying the model, the paper provides case study and statistical evidence that illustrate the degree to which national security concerns can inadvertently spill over with negative consequences into other domains."
