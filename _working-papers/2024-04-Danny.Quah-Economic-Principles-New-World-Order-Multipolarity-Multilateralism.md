excerpt: 'This paper argues that, besides geopolitical and security factors, economic variables are key drivers for world order.  While this is not the first time world order is splintering, economic interconnectedness traditionally raised fragmentation costs and thus served to hold the world together. Now, however, the logic is reversed:  economic integration is, instead, a prime contributor to fragmentation. New mindsets are, therefore, needed.  The paper proposes three guiding principles for world order: First, build mechanisms for inadvertent cooperation, requiring for success not explicit collaboration but just individual-nations advancing self-interest; second, separate out problem domains where only zero-sum outcomes are available from those where mutual gain is available, possibly by nudges; and third, provide space for constrained multilateralism---whether plurilateral, minilateral, or otherwise---that is open and inclusive, and that will allow full-blown multilateralism to re-emerge where possible.'
