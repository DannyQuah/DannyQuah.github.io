excerpt: "Public policy education is richly multi-dimensional. How will public policy schools, that provide training for the conduct of public policy, continue to succeed in today's fast-moving world faced with multi-dimensional challenges?  I propose an overarching challenge---the public policy challenge---whose solution remains appropriate as the variety of problems that public policy practitioners face continues to evolve. I then propose two features that I conjecture will be part of any solution: first, public policy needs to be front-facing; second, simple (if deep) economic ideas need to be central in the training we provide public policy students."
