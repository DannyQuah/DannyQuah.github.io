I don't think the current US administration has a plan for the international system.  

Almost everyone outside that Administration agrees world order is under stress.  They all say, nodding heads in agreement, this is because the international system's principal architect and chief sponsor no longer wishes to serve that supporting function  Indeed, the opposite: the hegemon is not just no longer sponsoring the system, it is actively pulling at the threads.  

Previous warnings had always been that the newly-emerging powers (the Global South), dissatisifed with the international system, would in due course play the revisionist card.  They would seek to remake the system in their own image.  This was because the rules of the game had been written in such a way as to disadvantage those rising powers.  The irony, however, is that the most significant disruption to world order today comes instead from its original architect, the same agent who had written the rules of the game in order to benefit itself.  The further irony is that the revisionist reasoning is the same, namely that the international system has been disadvantageous to its disruptor.  

The crucial difference, however, is much less remarked on.  The revisionist emerging powers, in the common narrative, had a plan for how their new world order would look.  My hypothesis is that, in contrast, today's revisionist power has no plan for its preferred new world order - at least not to any degree resembling that envisioned by previous US administrations, all the way back from Eisenhower, past Clinton, and up through Obama.  

To test this hypothesis, a body of evidence needs to be assembled.  But the first item of that evidence is already visible, and it is this:  Trump 1.0 tore up TPP.  Japan and others decided to build another, excluding the US, but based on much the same principles.  They called it CPTPP.  At no time in the remainder of Trump 1.0, the intervening years, all of Trump 2.0 that we've seen, has Trump or his enduring associates said a single word about CPTPP.  If the ideas in TPP were so awful and objectionable, why has CPTPP never been worth mentioning.  

My hunch is, the current administration and America more generally for the next decade care a lot about the things that lap up on America's shores.  But anything beyond that is close to invisible to them.  Today, the US administration cares a lot aboout China's manufacturing prowess.  It does not want more exports that will continue to inflict the China Shock on America's workers, industries, and middle-class communities.  It wants to trade with China and others, but on bilateral terms: America will remain what it thinks of as a trading nation.  Conditional on that, the US will not care if those Chinese exports go to some nation in Africa or the rest of Asia.  America is shrewd enough, however, about not allowing chain-washing: China's exports elsewhere shouldn't be re-exported and show up in America.  That would then be something that laps up on America's shores, and America will be strict about that.  But apart from that, whatever.

America does not have a plan for the international economic system, only for itself.  

US imports today are about 11% of what the world exports altogether.  That doesn't have to go away, but it might diminish.  That reduction will be painful, both for the rest of us and for Americans. But it's not going to shatter world order.  

The two pieces of writing that Taimur and I discussed, that helps support what I say:  

My Foreign Policy open letter to the then-incoming US President argued that America does not need to be number 1. If it were really serious about being the number 1 nation, it ought to come back into the international system and show that it can indeed outperform on a level playing field.  But even if it doesn't, America can still be a (relatively) prosperous nation, paying attention to the outside world only through its being surrounded by friends (north, south) and fish (east, west), and dropping everything else.  The surprise is that the Trump administration seems to not mind taking friends out of the equation even, but we'll see how long that continues.  

My forthcoming Correlated Economics and Geopolitics article, forthcoming in the *The New Global Economic Order* (Ing and Rodrik, editors) says that we shouldn't be overly surprised at how world order has gone over the last eighty years.  That the international system has fractured as much as it has is shocking to those who think that no matter how bad geopolitics gets, economics (comparative advantage, win-win outcomes from trade) will hold things together.  But the fact is, international economics is not experienced by politically pivotal agents in terms of comparative advantage.  Instead, for those agents, the lived experience is the China Shock: the tsunami wave of imports stealing jobs, dismantling industry, turning into ghost towns what were once thriving middle-class communities.  This is how Americans now think about trade, so of course economics has grown collinear with geostrategic rivalry.  China is an enemy both on geopolitical and economic grounds.  And, surprise, the China Shock language has now crept into the political conversations in other nations too.  The fault lies not in economics (which still produces aggregate win-win outcomes from trade); the fault lies in policymakers that don't translate aggregate win-win outcomes into inclusive growth for their populations.
