I began by describing my understanding on the logic driving those such as Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who had, just recently, described his government's assessment of US tariffs on specific businesses and industries.  At the same time, however, the Prime Minister made clear the deeper concerns regarding the broader consequences for world order and the global economy.  

I made three points.  

First, everyone is vulnerable.  Whether or not all America's trade actions or its security recalibration are ultimately rolled back, the "Liberation Day 2025" actions show that your nation can have the US act against you.  It doesn't matter if you have zero tariffs on US imports, have the US run a trade surplus against you, are a democracy, are not the People's Republic of China, have outstanding security and economic treaties with the US (perhaps even signed by President Trump), or be in a centuries-old special relationship with America.  

Second, keep attention to the fraying of our multilateral system, not the idiosyncratic randomness of day to day individual pronouncements.  The large fact of the matter is, the US is actively undermining the rules-based multilateral system it built.  

Yes, of course, there are strategic security and economic reasons to its actions.  Those reasons do not overturn the harm that these are having on the international economic system, nor the standing of the US in world order.  It is sometimes thought that that last is controlled by how powerful the US is or how strong a military the US has.  It isn't.  For any given nation, it is the rest of the world that has ownership on that nation's standing and respect.  

Third, ASEAN needs to stand together and look to long-term regional solidarity.  We want the US (and any other Great Power) alongside us, of course.  But the response is ours alone to give when anyone asks too much of us.  The US has already withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, the World Health Organization, and in effect the World Trade Organization.  The two gravest errors we can make when we encounter a bully is to give in and then encourage them to ask for mre, and when we don't resolutely stand in unison but give in to the temptation to defect.  

Obviously, we shouldn't lash out in retaliation.  But then neither should we acquiesce and appease.  Not responding with opposition does not mean quietly giving in to appeasement.  There is clear blue water between these two extremes.  

Now more than ever is it important to look to opportunities for inadvertent cooperation.  We don't have to agree and we don't have to sign up to explicitly collaborate.  We simply have to ensure the other guy does the right thing, even if it's for the wrong reason.
