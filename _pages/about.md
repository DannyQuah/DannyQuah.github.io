I am Li Ka Shing Professor in Economics at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, NUS.  I work on geopolitics and world order from an economics perspective.  I also do research on social mobility and income inequality, growth, and economic development.  

In my work on world order, I analyze the supply and demand of international systems, contrasting the goals of the Great Powers and the needs of the global community.  I seek to help shape economic and geopolitical discourse through academic research, public commentary, and as a member of various international advisory committees.  

My earlier training and work were primarily in macroeconomics and timeseries econometrics. Ideas from there continue to be visible in my current work (but only if you watch out for them).  

This website seeks to be minimalist and lightweight.  The principal sections (also on the header of each page) are just [Publications](https://DannyQuah.github.io/publications/), [Working Papers](https://dannyquah.github.io/working-papers/), [Blog Posts](https://DannyQuah.github.io/year-archive/), and [Talks](https://DannyQuah.github.io/talks/).
