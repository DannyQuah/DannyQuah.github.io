I am Li Ka Shing Professor in Economics and Dean at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, NUS.  I work on geopolitics and world order from an economics perspective.  I also do research on income inequality, growth, and development.  My earlier training and work were primarily in macroeconomics and timeseries econometrics (ideas from there continue to be visible in my current work, but only if you watch out for them).  

On this website I am only gradually building out content as I continue to unify material from a range of other platforms.  For the time being, it has been just the Working Papers, Blog Posts, and Talks sections getting attention from me.  So please be patient on the other parts.
