This is the front page of my website, powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages.  

I am Li Ka Shing Professor in Economics and Dean at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, NUS.  I work on geopolitics and world order from an economics perspective.  I also do research on income inequality, growth, and development.  My earlier training and work were primarily in macroeconomics and timeseries econometrics (and ideas from there continue to be visible in my current work, but only if you watch out for them).  

On this website I am only gradually building out the content as I continue to try and unify the material, having moved here from a range of other disparate platforms.  For the time being, it has been mostly the Working Papers and Blog sections seeing greatest attention from me.  So please be patient on the other parts.
